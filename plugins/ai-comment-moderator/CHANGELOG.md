  - Import prompts from JSON
  - Overwrite or skip duplicates
  - Version tracking in exports
  - Share prompts between sites

### Example Enhanced Prompt

```
Analyze this comment with full context:

Content: {comment_content}

Context Intelligence:

## [1.0.3] - 2025-01-13

### Fixed
- **🎯 MAJOR**: Sync now tracks pagination state - each click fetches NEXT batch, not same batch
  - Previously: Clicked sync 3 times, only worked once (fetched pages 1-5 repeatedly)
  - Now: Click 1 = pages 1-5, Click 2 = pages 6-10, Click 3 = pages 11-15, etc.
  - Pagination state persists between syncs using `wp_options` table
  - Auto-resets to page 1 when sync completes or reaches end

### Added
- **Reset button** for each remote site to manually restart pagination from page 1

- **Better progress feedback**: "Synced pages 6-10. 500 new, 0 updated. Total in cache: 1,000"
- **Completion detection**: Message shows "✓ All synced!" when complete

### Changed
- `store_remote_comments()` now returns both `stored` and `updated` counts

- See `SYNC_FIX_V2.md` for detailed technical explanation

## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-13

### Fixed
- **🐛 CRITICAL**: Remote site sync now properly paginates through comments
  - Was fetching the same 100 comments repeatedly
  - Now correctly fetches unique comments across multiple pages
  - Added `$page` parameter to `fetch_comments()` function
  - AJAX sync loop now passes page numbers to API

- Shows remaining comment count after each sync
- Prompts user to sync again if more comments exist
- Added pagination metadata (X-WP-Total, X-WP-TotalPages) to response
- Created diagnostic test script (`test-sync-debug.php`) for troubleshooting

### Technical Details
- `fetch_comments()` signature: Added `$page = 1` parameter
- API URL now includes `page` query parameter
- Return data includes: `total_available`, `total_pages`, `current_page`
- See `PAGINATION_FIX.md` for detailed technical explanation

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-13

### Fixed
- **Remote Site Sync**: Converted sync operation to AJAX to prevent "headers already sent" error
