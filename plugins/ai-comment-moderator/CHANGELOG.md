## [1.0.4] - 2025-01-13

### Added
- **Configurable sync batch size**: Choose 500/1000/2000/5000/10000 comments per sync in Settings
  - Default increased from 500 to 1,000 comments for faster syncing
  - Higher values reduce clicks needed but may timeout on slow servers
- **Full remote site editing interface** with:
  - Edit site name, URL, username, and application password
  - Toggle site active/inactive without deleting
  - View site statistics (total comments, pending, last sync, created date)
  - Advanced actions: Reset pagination, Clear cache, Delete site
  - Security: Application password can be updated without showing current value
- **Clear comment cache button**: Delete all cached comments from a site to re-sync fresh

### Changed
- Default sync batch size: 500 ‚Üí 1,000 comments (10 pages instead of 5)
- Remote site edit page now fully functional (was placeholder "coming soon")
- Edit page includes comprehensive site management tools

### Technical
- New setting: `ai_comment_moderator_sync_pages_per_batch` (default: 10)
- New AJAX handler: `ai_moderator_clear_site_cache`
- Site editing validates all fields and only updates password if provided

## [1.0.3] - 2025-01-13

### Fixed
- **üéØ MAJOR**: Sync now tracks pagination state - each click fetches NEXT batch, not same batch
  - Previously: Clicked sync 3 times, only worked once (fetched pages 1-5 repeatedly)
  - Now: Click 1 = pages 1-5, Click 2 = pages 6-10, Click 3 = pages 11-15, etc.
  - Pagination state persists between syncs using `wp_options` table
  - Auto-resets to page 1 when sync completes or reaches end

### Added
- **Reset button** for each remote site to manually restart pagination from page 1
- **Update tracking**: Now reports both new inserts and existing comment updates
- **Local cache count**: Shows total comments in local database
- **Better progress feedback**: "Synced pages 6-10. 500 new, 0 updated. Total in cache: 1,000"
- **Completion detection**: Message shows "‚úì All synced!" when complete

### Changed
- `store_remote_comments()` now returns both `stored` and `updated` counts
- Sync message format completely redesigned for clarity
- Shows exact page range synced, new vs updated counts, and remaining count

### Technical
- Added `ai_moderator_last_sync_page_site_{site_id}` option for state tracking
- New AJAX handler: `ai_moderator_reset_sync_pagination`
- Pagination resets automatically when fewer than 100 comments returned
- See `SYNC_FIX_V2.md` for detailed technical explanation

## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-13

### Fixed
- **üêõ CRITICAL**: Remote site sync now properly paginates through comments
  - Was fetching the same 100 comments repeatedly
  - Now correctly fetches unique comments across multiple pages
  - Added `$page` parameter to `fetch_comments()` function
  - AJAX sync loop now passes page numbers to API

### Enhanced
- Sync feedback now shows total comments available on remote site
- Shows remaining comment count after each sync
- Prompts user to sync again if more comments exist
- Added pagination metadata (X-WP-Total, X-WP-TotalPages) to response
- Created diagnostic test script (`test-sync-debug.php`) for troubleshooting

### Technical Details
- `fetch_comments()` signature: Added `$page = 1` parameter
- API URL now includes `page` query parameter
- Return data includes: `total_available`, `total_pages`, `current_page`
- See `PAGINATION_FIX.md` for detailed technical explanation

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-13

### Fixed
- **Remote Site Sync**: Converted sync operation to AJAX to prevent "headers already sent" error
- **Comment Fetching**: Now fetches up to 500 comments per sync (5 pages √ó 100) instead of just 100
- **Batch Output**: Enhanced processing log to show comment author, site name, and content snippet

### Changed
- Sync button now provides real-time status updates without page reload
- Batch processing output now includes:
  - Comment author name
  - Source site name for remote comments
  - First 20 words of comment content
