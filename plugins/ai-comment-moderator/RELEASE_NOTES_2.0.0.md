## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **OpenRouter Model Cache**: Model list cached for 1 hour. Click "Refresh" to force update.
2. **API Key Requirements**: OpenAI, Claude, and OpenRouter require paid API keys.
3. **Budget Alerts**: Must be manually configured; not automatic.
4. **Cost Accuracy**: Depends on accurate token reporting from providers.
5. **Rate Limits**: Each provider has different rate limits; see their documentation.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error
- Verify key starts with correct prefix (sk- for OpenAI, sk-ant- for Claude)
- Check for extra spaces when pasting
- Ensure key hasn't been revoked in provider dashboard

### "Rate Limit Exceeded"
- Wait 60 seconds and try again
- Increase rate limit in Settings
- Consider upgrading API plan with provider

### Connection Test Fails
- Check your server can reach the internet
- Verify firewall doesn't block HTTPS requests
- Try a different provider to isolate issue

### Costs Higher Than Expected
- Check budget alert settings
- Review token usage in Analytics
- Consider using cheaper models (Haiku, GPT-3.5)
- Use Ollama for zero-cost alternative

## Upgrading Notes
