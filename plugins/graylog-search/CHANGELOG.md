## [1.6.5] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed
- **Hostname + Search Term Combination**: Fixed issue where searching with both hostname and search term returned no results
  - Search terms now explicitly search the `message` field: `message:term`
  - Query structure: `fqdn:hostname* AND message:searchterm`
  - Both hostname-only and search-term-only searches continue to work
  
### Added

  - Works with single terms or multiple phrases (separated by commas/newlines)
  - Makes it easy to spot what you searched for in the logs
  - Automatically added to the "Highlighted" section for easy removal

### How It Works
- Search terms from the "Search Terms" field are automatically highlighted when results appear
- Multiple search terms are each highlighted separately
- You can still manually highlight additional text by selecting it
- All highlights can be removed individually or with the "Clear All" button

## [1.6.3] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed
- **Phrase Search Support**: Search terms with spaces are now treated as exact phrases
  - Example: "CVSS v3 Score" now searches for that exact phrase (not CVSS OR v3 OR Score)
  - Phrases are automatically wrapped in quotes for Graylog
  - Multiple phrases can still be separated by commas or newlines
  - Backward compatibility: Hostnames and filters still split on spaces

### Technical
- Added `split_on_spaces` parameter to `graylog_parse_multivalue_input()`
- Search terms no longer split on spaces (phrases stay together)
- Hostnames and filter terms still split on spaces for backward compatibility

## [1.6.2] - 2025-10-13

### Changed
- **"Keep Only" renamed to "Filter In"**: More intuitive terminology for showing only matching rows
- **Auto-highlight on Filter In**: When using "Filter In", matching text is now automatically highlighted
- **Search Terms work without Hostname**: You can now search using only Search Terms field (Hostname is optional)
- **Improved Multi-Value Logic**: 
  - Multiple hostnames are now OR'ed together (find logs from server01 OR server02)
  - Multiple search terms are now OR'ed together (find logs with error OR warning)
  - Different field types are still AND'ed (hostname AND search_terms AND NOT filter_out)

### Fixed
- Multiple hostname searches now work correctly (OR logic instead of AND)
- Multiple search term searches now work correctly (OR logic instead of AND)

## [1.6.1] - 2025-10-13

### Added
- **Filter Display for All Actions**: "Keep Only" and "Highlight" actions now show in the active filters display
  - Color-coded badges: Red for "Filter Out", Green for "Keep Only", Yellow for "Highlight"
  - Icons for each filter type (dismiss, visibility, art)
  - Individual remove buttons for each filter/highlight
  - "Clear All" button removes all filters, keep-only filters, and highlights

### Fixed

## [1.5.3] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed

  - Now uses `hostname*` instead of `*hostname*`
  - Trailing wildcards are faster and widely supported in Graylog/Lucene
  - Avoids expensive leading wildcard searches that may be disabled
  - Searching "server01" now generates `fqdn:server01*` (matches `server01.example.com`)

### Changed
- Query builder updated: `fqdn:hostname` ‚Üí `fqdn:hostname*` (trailing wildcard only)
- Removes leading wildcard to improve performance and compatibility
