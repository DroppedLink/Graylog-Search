## Quick Tips

âœ… **Use the Builder** - It's the easiest way to create embeds with preview

âœ… **Enable Responsive** - Makes embeds mobile-friendly automatically

âœ… **Test URLs** - Some sites block embedding (Google.com, Facebook, etc.)

âœ… **Use HTTPS** - More secure and required by default

âœ… **Check Whitelist** - If a URL is blocked, add it to the whitelist in settings

## Troubleshooting

### "Empty Preview"

**Problem:** The preview is blank after clicking Generate.

**Cause:** The site blocks embedding (X-Frame-Options header).

**Solutions:**
- For YouTube/Maps: Use their embed URLs (not watch/view URLs)
- For your apps: See ENTERPRISE_APPS_GUIDE.md
- For external sites: They may not allow embedding

The plugin will show a fallback message on your site with a link.

### "URL Blocked"

**Problem:** Error message says URL is blocked.

**Cause:** Domain whitelist is enabled and domain not in list.

**Solution:** Go to Settings â†’ Add domain to "Allowed Domains"

### "HTTPS Required"

**Problem:** Error about HTTP not allowed.

**Cause:** HTTPS-only mode is enabled (recommended).

**Solution:** 
- Use HTTPS version of URL
- OR disable "HTTPS Only" in Settings (not recommended)
